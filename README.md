#COMPUTER GENETRATED SUMMARIES AND KEYWORD EXTRACTION FROM VIDEO CONTENT USING NLP TECHNIQUES

ABSTRACT
	Computer generated summaries using machine learning and natural language processing to transcribe spoken words from video recordings. In the current fast-paced environment, individuals and Organizationâ€™s regularly having to manage enormous amounts of data in the form of audio recordings, video recordings, and text documents. The manual summarization and transcription of such data can be laborious and time-consuming. Keyword extraction is a crucial step in the information retrieval and categorization of text. This problem has been resolved by computer generated note-taking software for video recordings. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used to transform spoken words into text, which is subsequently used to build a summary or set of notes and analyze the transcribed text to identify and extract key terms using spacy. Keywords are identified based on their frequency or importance within the transcribed text. Keyword extraction is a vital component of the project aim to efficiently manage and utilize video recordings in an educational context. It facilitates the creation of meaningful summaries, enables precise information retrieval, ultimately benefiting both educators and learners.

Step to be followed:
Step 1 - Install the necessary libraries.
Step 2 - Ensure you have the en_core_web_sm model for spaCy.
Step 3 - Replace the API key in the code with your valid AssemblyAI API key,if you want your private API to run.
Step 4 - Run the script using a Jupyter notebook or any python paltform.
Step 5 - The GUI window will appear. Use the "Browse" button to select a video file. Once selected, the video file   	 path will be displayed.
Step 6 - Click the "Convert" button to initiate the conversion process. A progress bar will run during the 		 conversion.
Step 7 - After completion, a message box will indicate whether the conversion was successful or if there was an 	 error.
Step 8 - The transcript and extracted keywords will be printed to the console.
Step 9 - The content will also be saved in a Word document named 'document.docx'.
